(clojure.core/defn initiate-multipart-upload "This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see UploadMultipartPart).\n When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.\n Every part you upload to this resource (see UploadMultipartPart), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB. \n  You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.\n  After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon Glacier removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID.

After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Amazon Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob.\n In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html). On the server side, Amazon Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Amazon Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.\n Additionally, Amazon Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Amazon Glacier returns an error and the operation fails.\n Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives.

You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart upload.\n Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is true:\n  \n *  SHA256 tree hash does not matchTo ensure that part data is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don't match, the operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html).\n  \n *  Part size does not matchThe size of each part except the last must match the size specified in the corresponding InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.\n  If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.\n   \n *  Range does not alignThe byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges.

You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob. \n You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading.

The List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation time.\n  Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists.\n  The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the response Marker field. If there are no more jobs to list, the Marker field is set to null. If there are more jobs to list, the Marker field is set to a non-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set the marker request parameter to the Marker value for that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs request.\n You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the response by specifying the limit parameter in the request. The default limit is 1000. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit.\n Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional statuscode parameter or completed parameter, or both.
